request of Principals, we proceeded to the vessel concerned

for the purpose of conducting draft-reading at initial and final stage, to estimate the quantity of the
consignment through calculating of the respective displacement of light and loaded vessel,
based on figures obtained through draft reading.

According to the relevant data available on board vessel as specified in attached schedule which
forms an inseparable part of this report, we arrive at the following figures :

Net Displacement light                    16,056 MT
Net Displacement loaded                  93,056 MT
Quantity of consignment                   77,000 MT

This report refers to ship's draft reading and reflects our findings at time and place of named
intervention only and does not constitute a statement of quantity as referred to in the
Metrology Law no. 2 year 1981.

It is issued without prejudice and upon the understanding that it will not serve as a document
representing a transfer of custody or title of the consignment concerned.

This Certificate/report is issued under our General Terms and Conditions, copy of which is available upon request or may be accessed at www.sucofindo.co.id
