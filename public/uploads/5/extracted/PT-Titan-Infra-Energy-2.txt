Samples on a lot basis were draw from the conveyor system in accordance with ISO Standards
as the consignment of coal was loaded onto the vessel.

Size tests carried out in accordance with ISO Standards "Higher rank coal - Size analysis"
showed that 74.52 % were between 3 mm and 50 mm, 9.27 % were above 50 mm, and 16.21 %
were below 3 mm.

Results of the analysis of the samples withdraw as above and analysed in accordance with ISO
‘Standards except for HGI which was analysed in accordance with ASTM Standards and
Inherent Moisture which was analysed to ISO Standards.
